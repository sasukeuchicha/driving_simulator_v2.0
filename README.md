# driving_simulator_v2.0
Changes that has been made from previous version
So, this project was made for my final year mandatory projects under B.E. The inspiration came up after I came across a video on youtube about colour detection using opencv library in python. So we decided to give it a go.
The entire code is free open source and you can download and modify as you wish. For any details follow a document that contains the report and ppt with pictorial directory for better understanding
